        <div>
            <p>For 2 years a man waited</p>
            <p>For a stamp and a note with confirmation</p>
            <p>He didn’t quit, fueled with determination</p>
            <p>2022, an email came</p>
            <p>“Congratulations!” </p>
            <p>Accepted, at last, to the dream he held tight</p>
            <p>But before he could step through that door,</p>
            <p>The consulate said “no”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Tears were shed, but he didn’t succumb</p>
            <p>Life goes on, he did not give up</p>
            <p>He got married, still having that dream in mind</p>
            <p>To enter that university, and have a good life</p>
            <p>He applied, but got denied</p>
            <p>Tried two more times, and still got denied</p>
            <p>“One last try” he said</p>
            <p>The last try worked, and his dream was revived</p>
        </div>
        <div class="next">
        <p>That dream had a price, and time was running out</p>
        <p>So he worked</p>
        <p>Three jobs, one after the other</p>
        <p>With side gigs in between and no time to cry</p>
        <p>The weight was heavy, but the sacrifice would be worth it</p>
        <p>Days passed by, he endured the trial</p>
        <p>Finally, the time had come</p>
        <p>A new chapter begins, and the dreams within reach</p>
        </div>
        <div>
        <p>Now he stands with no regret in his eyes</p>
        <p>With his wife by his side, their dreams intertwined</p>
        <p>This is my story, still can’t believe this is real</p>
        <p>Every step was worth it, every moment was real</p>
        <p>My dream has been fulfilled</p>
        <p>In the Home of the Brave, and the Land of the Free.</p>
