        <p style="text-align:center; max-width: 800px; margin: auto;">
            We’re a group of driven students with roots in Samoa, the Philippines, and Florida — united by our diverse cultures and a common purpose: to serve and uplift our community. With a strong passion for hard work, fresh ideas, and a heart for helping others, we bring energy, reliability, and creativity to every project we take on. Whether it’s your home, yard, or business, we treat it with the same care and commitment as we would our own. Give us a chance, and we’ll show you what a dedicated, community-focused team can do.
