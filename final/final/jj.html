            <p class="ptext">John Jayme Vicente, currently known as Elder Vicente, is serving faithfully in the Philippines Naga Mission. As the second child in the family, he’s always stood out for his sharp mind and love for problem-solving. From Legos to Rubik’s cubes to any kind of puzzle, Jayjay has a knack for figuring things out and thinking steps ahead. He’s often seen as the smartest one among us, not just because of his intelligence, but also because of his focus and determination. We’re proud of the way he is using those strengths to serve the Lord and bless others on his mission.</p>
