            <p class="ptext">John Thomas Vicente is the youngest of four siblings, and he brings a whole lot of personality to the mix. With big dreams of becoming a pilot one day, he’s always had his eyes on the skies. When he’s not talking about airplanes, you’ll probably find him deep into a game—whether it’s Valorant, Warzone, Minecraft, or anything that gets his heart racing and his mind strategizing. His passion for gaming, paired with his curiosity and drive, shows just how focused he can be when he sets his sights on something. He’s got big goals and the energy to chase them.</p>
