                <p>Raymond and Marylene Vicente have been married for 27 years, building a life centered on faith, love, and service. Both served their full-time missions in the Philippines Davao Mission, where their testimonies grew stronger and their hearts more prepared for the path ahead. They were sealed in the Philippines Manila Temple, beginning their eternal journey together. Today, they are serving as mission leaders in the newly opened Philippines General Santos Mission, guiding and inspiring young missionaries with kindness and devotion. Marylene grew up in a lively home with 13 siblings, while Raymond was raised as the only child in his family. Together, they make a beautiful team with a story rooted in love, balance, and purpose.</p>
