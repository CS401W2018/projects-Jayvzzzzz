        <h1>My Family</h1>

        <h2>Why?</h2>
        <p>The topic of my website would be about my family because they are my inspiration on why I chose to pursue this career. Since there are 7 of us, it would be perfect for the requirement for this project.</p>
        <h3>What Would Be The Content?</h3>
        <p>On my home page, I would display our family picture. For the navigation, it would be each of our nicknames and each page would direct them about that specific family member, some facts about them, and what their hobbies are, so that would be 6 pages in total.</p>
        <h2>Main Page</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Family Picture</li>
            <li>Family Members</li>
            <li>Family Traditions</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>2nd to 7th Page</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Picture of the family member</li>
            <li>Name of the family member</li>
            <li>Facts about them</li>
            <li>Hobbies</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Table Content</h3>
        <p>In the homepage as well, I would include a table with each of our favorite snacks, where to buy it, and how much it costs.</p>
        <h3>Form Content</h3>
        <p>For the form, I would ask the user to enter his name, age, email, and a text box for what theyw ant to say to our family, like a message for us or any food request.</p>
        <h3>How To Collect My Content</h3>
        <p>For the information, images, and contents, I would use our pictures, links to websites that talks about our family and our hobbies. Since I like basketball and is a big NBA fan, I would link that as well. I would Reference the NBA website. Because we love food, I would also include links to different dishes that I would be talking about, and I think I might use wikipedia for reference too.</p>
        <h3>References to be used:</h3>
        <p><a href="https://www.nba.com/">NBA</a></p>
        <p><a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/?lang=eng&cid=rdb_v_ldsorg">Church Website</a></p>
