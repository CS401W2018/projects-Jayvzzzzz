        <h3>Naruto is one of my favorite anime characters. It is also the first anime series that I finished watching. After Naruto was born, his parents died. But that did not stop him to achieve his dream of becoming a Hokage or a leader of their village</p>
        <p>Naruto trained hard everyday so that he could become a strong ninja. He trained hard day and night and with the help of his mentors, he was able to unlock his full potential. Later on, he was able to become the Hokage of Konoha Village. His people loved him and he was able to protect their village throughout his life.</h3>
