        <h1 id="why">Why Basketball?</h1>
        <p>Growing up in the <span class="bold bigger">Philippines</span>, I was exposed at an early age to basketball. My dad, my uncle, my cousins, and most of my friends play basketball. I learned how to play it and I loved it! I love it mainly because it is such a good feeling whenever I score a basket or when preventing someone from scoring. </p>
        <p>I also got exposed to the NBA. Because of that, I got to know my favorite basketball player. (Link is on the top)</p>
