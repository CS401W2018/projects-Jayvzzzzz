                    <p>I have 3 younger siblings. We only have 1 sister and she is a tough one. We have different forte in life. I am the funny one, my 2nd brother is a smart guy, my sister is so active in everything, and my youngest brother has a mix of all our attributes. I am doing my best to be the older brother that they would look up to.</p>

                    <p>This is my wife. We've been married for almost 2 years now. She can play any kind of instrument and she is a really smart woman (that's why she chose me). When she was in high school, she was a mayor for a day and a class valedictorian. She was also able to get a good scholarship from a famous university in the Philippines</p>
