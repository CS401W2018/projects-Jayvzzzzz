    <h1>My Favorite NBA Team and Basketball Player</h1><hr>
    <p>Growing up, I really loved basketball. I'm not that good but I really enjoy playing it. Right now, my favorite team is the <mark> Golden State Warriors </mark> even though they are not really doing good this season, I still support them because I served in the bay area and that helped me to become a huge warriors fan. What also made me a fan of the warriors is the way they pass the ball around and how they are all really good 3pt shooters.</p>
    <p>I love the warriors basketball team but my favorite player is not on their team. My favorite basketball playr that is still alive and playing today is <strong>Kawhi Leonard</strong>. He is my favorite player because he was the one that stopped Lebron James way back 2014. He is an excellent defender &amp; a great scorer as well and that is why he is my favorite player right now. Kawhi is my favorite player right now but I have a list of my all time favorites as well like:</p>
    <ol type="A">
        <li>Kobe Bryant</li>
        <li>Michael Jordan</li>
        <li>Tracy McGrady</li>
        <li>Vince Carter</li>
    </ol>
